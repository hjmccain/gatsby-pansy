      Sunday, March 26, 2023 — Join us at the Apocalypse Garden for the launch
      of <span className="italic">Creature of Habit</span> by Tucson-based poet,
      Hannah Lawless. Her chapbook explores gender, lust, love — as well as
      washing dishes, picking dandelions, holding snakes. These are short poems
      that hold fascinating depths, their meanings layered and partially
      obscured, with simplicity of language belying a complexity of emotion.
      <br />
      <br />
      Hannah will be reading from her chapbook, and she will be joined by local
      poets Sophie Daws and Jeff Evans. Sophie will be reading work-in-progress
      poems — a chance to see poetry as it forms. Jeff will be presenting
      several poetry performance pieces with a small group of performers — a
      melding of his work as a poet with that of his work as a professional
      choral conductor and music teacher.

          In this workshop, participants will be introduced to key poetic
          concepts from the perspective of visual writing. We will explore the
          shared languages of images and poetry and will interact and discuss
          some of the many iterations of their use in conjunction: ekphrastic
          poems, concrete poems, erasures, and other hybrid forms. Participants
          can choose to participate in one or both days. Participants will be
          provided with short readings prior to the workshop days as well as in
          the workshop.

            Workshop Day 1: Poetry in Response to Image and Poetry as Image
          </h3>
          In day one of the workshop, we will open with a collaborative writing
          warm-up. We will then discuss the basics of reading poetry broadly as
          well as the basics of reading visual poetry. We will learn about
          ekphrastic poems and concrete poems and take a look at works by Danez
          Smith, Morgan Parker, Taylor Johnson, and CAConrad, among others.
          Participants will write their own ekphrastic and concrete poems and
          are encouraged to come with some favorite works of visual art in mind.

            Workshop Day 2: Working with Personal Ephemera and Revision
            Practices
          </h3>
          In day two of the workshop, we will learn about erasures and other
          hybrid forms by taking a look at works by Chase Berggrun, Monica Ong,
          and Diana Khoi Nguyen. For this day, participants will be asked to
          bring personal images, documents, and other ephemera of interest to
          engage with. We will also discuss some potential strategies for
          revising work, and participants will select a couple of poems to
          revise.
