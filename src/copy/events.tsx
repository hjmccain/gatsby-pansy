          In this workshop, participants will be introduced to key poetic
          concepts from the perspective of visual writing. We will explore the
          shared languages of images and poetry and will interact and discuss
          some of the many iterations of their use in conjunction: ekphrastic
          poems, concrete poems, erasures, and other hybrid forms. Participants
          can choose to participate in one or both days. Participants will be
          provided with short readings prior to the workshop days as well as in
          the workshop.

            Workshop Day 1: Poetry in Response to Image and Poetry as Image
          </h3>
          In day one of the workshop, we will open with a collaborative writing
          warm-up. We will then discuss the basics of reading poetry broadly as
          well as the basics of reading visual poetry. We will learn about
          ekphrastic poems and concrete poems and take a look at works by Danez
          Smith, Morgan Parker, Taylor Johnson, and CAConrad, among others.
          Participants will write their own ekphrastic and concrete poems and
          are encouraged to come with some favorite works of visual art in mind.

          bring personal images, documents, and other ephemera of interest to
          engage with. We will also discuss some potential strategies for
          revising work, and participants will select a couple of poems to
          revise.
