    Hannah Joyce (she/her) and Jeff Evans (he/him) started Pansy Press in the
    summer of 2021 when Jeff texted Hannah, whom he hadn't seen in almost a
    year, and said, "Hey, would you want to start a poetry press?" and the
    enthusastic response was "YES."
    <br />
    <br />
    Pansy was conceived of as a space where poetry could grow & breath in real
    time, and in real life. So often, poetry is relegated to spaces of academia
    â€” which are amazing, but often inaccesible or intimidating. We think of
    Pansy as analogous to a local band putting out tapes of their own music &
    their friends'. It's DIY. It's perhaps unpolished (but it's a lot of fun).
    Most importantly, it's by & for the community that it is a part of.
    <br />
    <br />
    Today, Pansy is mostly about poetry, but it's also a little bit about every
    creative pursuit happening at the local level within the living & breathing
    community of active artists that Hannah & Jeff are a part of. It's about the
    art that's happening in your backyard, being created by people you know.
    What a fucking privilege and an honor! Pansy Press is so glad to know you,
    and if we don't know you, we want to meet you. Pansy is art in community.
    Come join us :)
